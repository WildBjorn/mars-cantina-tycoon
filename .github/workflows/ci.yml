# This workflow installs dependencies, lints the codebase, runs unit and
# end‑to‑end tests, builds the project and, on pushes to `main`, deploys
# the resulting `dist` directory to GitHub Pages. It uses the official
# GitHub Actions for Node and Pages, and caches node_modules to speed up
# subsequent runs.
