# Asset Credits

This project strives to use only artworks released into the public domain or
equivalent, such as the [CC0 1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)
license. When no appropriate asset could be found the game falls back to
procedurally drawn placeholders.

## Tiles

| Asset              | Author   | Source | License |
|--------------------|---------|--------|---------|
| Cobblestone floor tile (32×32) | eurydike | OpenGameArt: “Ground texture tiles 32 x 32”【122813661153566†L64-L104】 | CC0 1.0 |

The cobblestone texture is used as the default floor tile in the build and
service scenes. It was released into the public domain and may be used
without attribution.

## Furniture & UI

Most furniture items (bar counters, tap stations, tables, chairs and other
fixtures) currently use simple geometric placeholders drawn at runtime. As the
project progresses these can be replaced with CC0 sprites from Kenney.nl or
OpenGameArt.org. When suitable CC0 assets are adopted they should be listed
here with their authors, sources and licences.
